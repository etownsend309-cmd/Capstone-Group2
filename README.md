# Capstone-Group2

Source code for MIST capstone project.

The repository holds two things:

1. **ClausePilot**, a local agreement review prototype. This is the default view.
2. The **PDF text extraction harness** from Jira ticket KAN-402, kept as a
   separate view so its measurements stay reproducible.

Both run entirely in the browser. There is no backend, no database, and no
Python.

## ClausePilot: the agreement review prototype

A local, testable first-pass workflow for vendor agreements. It can:

- accept text-based PDF and TXT agreements;
- extract PDF text in the browser;
- identify the team's **12 approved CUAD playbook categories** with local
  deterministic rules;
- attach a confidence indicator and supporting source text to every finding;
- let a reviewer accept, dismiss, escalate, or manually add findings;
- complete a review and show category-level reporting;
- switch between Requester, Reviewer, Approver, and Administrator views; and
- keep its records in browser storage, so nothing leaves the machine.

No AI service or backend is required. **Prototype records are kept in browser
storage, so do not use real confidential agreements.**

### The 12 approved categories

Governing Law, Anti-Assignment, Cap On Liability, Audit Rights, Termination For
Convenience, Exclusivity, Renewal Term, Insurance, Change Of Control, Uncapped
Liability, Notice Period To Terminate Renewal, Warranty Duration.

Indemnification is deliberately **not** a standalone category. The demo
agreement contains indemnification language so that Uncapped Liability has
something to match, but no finding is produced for indemnification itself.
`tests/unit/analyze.test.ts` asserts both the category list and the fact that
the demo agreement exercises all 12.

## The KAN-402 extraction harness

The capstone needs to read text out of vendor agreement PDFs. Before building
anything on that assumption, KAN-402 asked three questions:

1. How well does PDF.js read a contract PDF?
2. What happens when it cannot read one?
3. When should the team stop trying and ask for supplied plaintext instead?

The harness answers those by parsing a PDF in the browser, reconstructing the
text two different ways, measuring both, and refusing to call an empty result a
success. Findings and the provisional recommendation are in
[`docs/pdf-extraction-poc.md`](docs/pdf-extraction-poc.md); the measured numbers are in
[`artifacts/pdf-benchmark-results.md`](artifacts/pdf-benchmark-results.md).

ClausePilot uses the same engine (`src/pdf/`) through a thin adapter at
`src/lib/extractText.ts`, which also adds TXT support. The adapter prefers the
coordinate reconstruction strategy, because the benchmark shows the two
strategies tie on single-column documents while stream order interleaves the
columns of a two-column agreement.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20.19 or newer (developed on Node 22)
- npm

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/etownsend309-cmd/Capstone-Group2.git
cd Capstone-Group2
npm install
```

To run the browser tests you also need Playwright's browsers once:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

## Running the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:5173>. Choose **Load demo agreement** to exercise
the full workflow without supplying a file.

The extraction harness is at <http://127.0.0.1:5173/?view=extraction-poc>, also
reachable from the link at the bottom of the sidebar. Drop a PDF onto its upload
panel, label it, and press **Run extraction**.

To check a production build locally:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Commands

| Command                | What it does                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`          | Start the Vite dev server                                        |
| `npm run build`        | Typecheck, then build for production into `dist/`                |
| `npm run preview`      | Serve the production build                                       |
| `npm run typecheck`    | TypeScript with no emit, across app and scripts                  |
| `npm test`             | Vitest: unit and component tests                                 |
| `npm run test:e2e`     | Playwright browser tests                                         |
| `npm run fixtures`     | Regenerate the test PDFs in `fixtures/generated/`                |
| `npm run benchmark`    | Measure every fixture and rewrite `artifacts/pdf-benchmark-results.{json,md}` |

### Why the fixtures are committed

`fixtures/generated/` is checked in rather than built on demand, so `npm test`
works on a fresh clone and the benchmark numbers describe the same documents
everyone else has.

Generation is deterministic: the document timestamps are pinned in
`scripts/generateFixtures.ts`, so `npm run fixtures` reproduces byte-identical
files. If regenerating ever does change them, the content genuinely changed, and
the benchmark should be re-run so `artifacts/` stays consistent.

### Two layers of test, on purpose

`npm test` covers the playbook rules, the extraction logic against the real
fixture PDFs, and the harness UI rendered under jsdom. It needs nothing but
Node.

`npm run test:e2e` covers the same UI behaviour in a real browser, where a real
PDF.js worker and real file downloads are involved. It needs a browser, so it is
kept separate rather than being the only thing that verifies the interface.

`npm run test:e2e` accepts a browser project: `--project=chromium` (default),
`--project=firefox`, or `--project=chrome` to drive a Google Chrome that is
already installed instead of downloading Playwright's own Chromium — useful on a
machine or network that cannot reach the Playwright CDN.

## Technology stack

| Purpose             | Choice                                    |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| UI                  | React 19 + TypeScript 5.9                 |
| Build / dev server  | Vite 7                                    |
| PDF parsing         | `pdfjs-dist` 6.3.289 (PDF.js, legacy build) |
| Unit and component tests | Vitest 5 (Node, plus jsdom for components) |
| Browser tests       | Playwright                                |
| Fixture generation  | `pdf-lib` and `jimp`                      |

The PDF.js **`legacy`** build is used in both the browser and the Node scripts.
Using one build means the benchmark measures the same code path the app runs.

## Layout

```
src/App.tsx       ClausePilot: shell, intake, review queue, decisions, reports
src/lib/          Playbook analyzer and the extraction adapter
src/pdf/          PDF.js driver, the two reconstruction strategies, measurement, report
src/poc/          The KAN-402 extraction harness and its components
scripts/          Fixture generator and benchmark runner (TypeScript, run with tsx)
tests/unit/       Vitest: pure functions, real-fixture extraction, jsdom component tests
tests/e2e/        Playwright browser tests
fixtures/generated/  Committed synthetic PDFs plus their expected text
fixtures/private/    Git-ignored space for approved local PDFs
artifacts/        Committed benchmark output
docs/             Written findings
```

The two views own separate global stylesheets that both style `body`, `button`,
and `.panel`. `src/main.tsx` imports one view and its stylesheet on demand so
the two never collide.

### A note on `index.html`

The repository's original `index.html` landing page is now the Vite entry point,
because Vite requires `index.html` at the project root. Its original sentence is
preserved inside the `<noscript>` block, so it is still what a visitor sees
without JavaScript.

## Testing a private or real PDF

Put it in `fixtures/private/`, which is git-ignored, and follow
[`fixtures/private/README.md`](fixtures/private/README.md). Automated tests use
only `fixtures/generated/`.

## Privacy

This is for local evaluation only.

- PDFs are processed in the browser. There is no server to upload them to.
- Extracted text is never logged. Developer diagnostics go to `console.debug`
  and carry no document content.
- No uploaded PDF is stored. Resetting or reloading discards it.
- ClausePilot keeps agreement records, including extracted text, in this
  browser's `localStorage`. Clear site data to remove them.
- Exported harness reports contain metrics and your notes, not extracted text,
  unless you explicitly opt in — and then only a 300-character excerpt.
- Do not commit real agreements. `fixtures/private/`, `artifacts/local/`, and
  exported `pdf-extraction-report-*` files are git-ignored.

## Known limitations

### The review workflow

- **Rule confidence values are prototype indicators,** not evaluated model
  scores. They are fixed constants per category.
- **One finding per category.** The analyzer stops at the first pattern that
  matches, so a second occurrence elsewhere in the document is not flagged.
- **Browser storage only.** Records live in `localStorage`, are not shared
  between browsers or machines, and have no migration path.
- **No authentication or access control.** The role switcher changes what the
  interface offers; it does not enforce anything.
- **Not wired yet:** database persistence, server-side access control, and an
  AI classifier.

### Extraction

- **No OCR.** PDF.js reads a PDF's existing text layer. A scanned or
  image-only PDF has none, so extraction correctly returns nothing and the
  reviewer is told why. OCR is a separate technology decision; see the OCR
  research note in [`docs/pdf-extraction-poc.md`](docs/pdf-extraction-poc.md).
- **Two strategies, one engine.** Both strategies read the same PDF.js parse.
  They compare ways of *reconstructing* text, not competing PDF engines.
- **The coordinate strategy is an experiment,** not a layout engine. It handles
  one column gutter per page; tables and rotated text are not reconstructed
  faithfully.
- **The low-text threshold is a heuristic** (fewer than 50 printable characters
  per page), not a confidence score.
- **Character count measures volume, not quality.** The multi-column fixture
  produces identical counts from both strategies in completely different reading
  orders.
- **No password-protected PDF support.** Encrypted files are reported as a
  failure with the fallback offered.
- **Not production architecture.** No authentication, no persistence beyond the
  browser, no deployment.
